# LazyCSS
Simple and clean CSS.
You need to download normalize.css from https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css
so it can deal with browser conflicts.
No @media query but it responsive. Responsive and mobile-friendly. Suitable for one page with no images and videos.
Sorry for my English. I hope you can understand my writing.
